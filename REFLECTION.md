\# Reflection



\## What was the most helpful aspect of this code’s structure?

The most helpful part was how the reading data was stored as an array of objects, because it made the loops and functions easy to follow and organize.



\## What part was confusing or took longer to understand?

The part that took longer was understanding how the book counting worked in mostReadBook(), especially how the object keeps track of totals before choosing the max.
